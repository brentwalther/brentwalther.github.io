I'd heard tracks from this album before but couldn't remember if I had listened
to it entirely so I decided to give it a listen. One turned into two. This album
is very strong in beats, lyrics, variety, and content. Denzel comes off pretty
agressive in many of his flows but don't let that fool you: he hides some really
good lines underneath this persona. Would highly recommend a listen. My favorite
tracks are _ULT_, _Me Now_, and _Story: No Title_.
