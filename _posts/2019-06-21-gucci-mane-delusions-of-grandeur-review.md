OG ATL Guwop strikes again with a album full of banging beats, witty rhymes, and a decent set of features on this new album. I've been a Gucci fan for quite some time and was really excited to hear about this new album (it sort of came out of nowhere). Gucci seems as confident as ever (as the title suggests) but still delivers a flow (at times) that honestly does sound freestyled. My favorite tracks were *Proud of You*, *Blind*, and *Potential*.
