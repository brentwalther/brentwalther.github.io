title: Boid Flocking Demo
---
A simulation of [boid flocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) that I
built Spring 2015 for Dr. Keyser's Physically Based Modeling (CSCE-649) class at
Texas A&M using three.js and vanilla Javascript.

In the demo below, you can use the WASD keys to move around. You'll notice three
flocks (red, blue, and green) along with white agitator boids that change
position. The spinning cubes are just for added affect and the boids should
generally avoid them.
