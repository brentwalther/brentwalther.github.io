I didn't love the album but didn't hate it either. I gave it a full listen
through and think Baby had some reasonably lyrics and flows but he's a little
hard to listen to over a full album. The features were good though and I
appreciated hearing Wayne and Moneybagg Yo. Maybe I'll give it another try some
time. No tracks really stood out to me after one listen.
