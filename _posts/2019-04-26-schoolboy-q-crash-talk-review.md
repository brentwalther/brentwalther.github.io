I'm a big Q fan so was really looking forward to this album after its announcement. I listened to [his interview on the Breakfast Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrRQHybTjvA) where he mentioned the style of this album would be different than his others. I agree - you won't find many hard bangers on this album but you'll still find the same 'groovy' style that is quite listenable. I didn't add any tracks from it to a playlist, but I enjoyed *5200* and *Attention*.
