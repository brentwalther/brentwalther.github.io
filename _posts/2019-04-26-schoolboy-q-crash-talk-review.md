I'm a big Q fan so was really looking forward to this album after its
announcement. I listened to
[his interview on the Breakfast Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrRQHybTjvA)
where he mentioned the style of this album would be different than his others. I
agree - you won't find many hard bangers on this album but you'll still find the
same 'groovy' style that is quite listenable. I didn't add any tracks from it to
a playlist, but I enjoyed _5200_ and _Attention_.
