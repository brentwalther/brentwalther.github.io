I didn't know what to expect from this album as I had only heard the single
_Trap_. I enjoyed the single and the album surprised me with by being really
good all the way through. It has the that mixed R&B and rap vibe and has
some great features. Smooth bass and harmonies. My favorites were _Trap_ and
_Anything Can Happen_.
