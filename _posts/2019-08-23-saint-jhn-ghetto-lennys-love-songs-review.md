I didn't know what to expect from this album as I had only heard the single *Trap*. I enjoyed the single and the album surprised me with by being really good all the way through. It has the that mixed R&amp;B and rap vibe and has some great features. Smooth bass and harmonies. My favorites were *Trap* and *Anything Can Happen*.
