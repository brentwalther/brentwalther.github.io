This album seemed very introspective and emotional and I don't know if I've
listened through any of Boogie's prior albums but I really enjoyed the flow he
had on this project. Despite having a lot of good content, it's still very
listenable (I listened to it twice through back-to-back and could have gone on
to a third. Standout tracks were _Rainy Days (Ft. Eminem)_, _Skydive II (Ft.
6LACK)_, and _Self Destruction_.
