This album seemed very introspective and emotional and I don't know if I've listened through any of Boogie's prior albums but I really enjoyed the flow he had on this project. Despite having a lot of good content, it's still very listenable (I listened to it twice through back-to-back and could have gone on to a third. Standout tracks were *Rainy Days (Ft. Eminem)*, *Skydive II (Ft. 6LACK)*, and *Self Destruction*.
