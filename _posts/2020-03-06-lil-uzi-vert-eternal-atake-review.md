When grabbing the album art for this one, I saw the pitchfork headline "Long,
Bumpy Road" and I couldn't help but think "Yeah... this sounds rough." I'm not a
huge fan of Uzi but definitely acknowledge he's seen some incredible mainstream
success on a number of songs. This album though just isn't very interesting in
my opinion and lacks radio-playable tracks. The fact that _P2_ was just a fresh
rap over his most popular beat seemed disingenuous and across the album his
flows didn't stand out as original.
