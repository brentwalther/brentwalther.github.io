When grabbing the album art for this one, I saw the pitchfork headline "Long, Bumpy Road" and I couldn't help but think "Yeah... this sounds rough." I'm not a huge fan of Uzi but definitely acknowledge he's seen some incredible mainstream success on a number of songs. This album though just isn't very interesting in my opinion and lacks radio-playable tracks. The fact that *P2* was just a fresh rap over his most popular beat seemed disingenuous and across the album his flows didn't stand out as original.
