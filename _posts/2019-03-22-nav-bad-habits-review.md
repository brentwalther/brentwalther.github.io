I liked the features on this album and I think the production is really good
(it's executive produced by The Weeknd, apparently). In my opinion, Nav is still
just too boring of an MC to keep my attention. Luckily for him, this album has a
lot of help backing him up and pushed it up to a 3. If I had to pick a stand out
track, I'd choose _Hold Your Breath_ or _Vicodin_.
