## Common reasons for taking the course

One of the reasons I originally cited for taking the course was to help bridge the gap between modern media culture and my technical background in computer science. I found others who share that theme: [[1]](http://thatsranjita.weebly.com/about.html), [[2]](http://people.tamu.edu/~phillipdang/), [[3]](http://students.cs.tamu.edu/nathan/home.html), [[4]](http://santossolorzano.com/445/).

Others took the lazy route and said things like "sounded interesting", "I need it for graduation", or "easy class": [[1]](http://people.tamu.edu/~spyrochad/), [[2]](http://sterlingenrique.azurewebsites.net/), [[3]](http://people.tamu.edu/~mokshesh1994/), [[4]](http://people.tamu.edu/~ruggiero3x/), [[5]](https://medium.com/@c_nolan/computers-and-the-new-media-why-i-m-taking-this-course-175f231b13af#.80zc06749).

Still, others were explicitly interested in seeing how modern media directly influences people: [[1]](http://people.tamu.edu/~josh.tutt/), [[2]](http://people.tamu.edu/~pawansingh9/cnm/), [[3]](http://nickj4.weebly.com/).

## Media usage patterns

One common theme that resonated with most everyone in the class is the consumption of online streaming audio and video. Many people no longer watch much television and instead get video content on sites like Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube or music services like Spotify, Pandora, or Soundcloud: [[1]](http://saifilali.weebly.com/), [[2]](http://adavis-cnm.weebly.com/media-usage.html), [[3]](http://cnm.philayer.com/about-me/), [[4]](http://students.cs.tamu.edu/nathan/home.html), [[5]](https://sites.google.com/a/tamu.edu/harsheikh/).

Another huge (and relatively new) media form is communication and social networking apps on cell phones such as Whatsapp, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram: [[1]](http://cskarthik.wix.com/newmedia#!assignment-1/cfaf), [[2]](http://adavis-cnm.weebly.com/media-usage.html), [[3]](http://findharish.com/445.html), [[4]](http://people.tamu.edu/~juicepaper/), [[5]](https://sites.google.com/a/tamu.edu/harsheikh/).

Lastly, a very large recurring media consumption type is video games. Like Janet Murray mentioned in Hamlet on the Holodeck, massively multiplayer video games are a new and exciting way to connect people and to experience a fantasy world that individuals may otherwise never get to experience. Some examples: [[1]](http://students.cse.tamu.edu/mwiecek/656/), [[2]](http://findharish.com/445.html), [[3]](http://sterlingenrique.azurewebsites.net/Assignment1).

## Other observations

I did find a great link on Wesley Vance's page about [Mkyaljsk Vasjkn](http://wesadvance.mkyaljskvasjkn.com/contents/mkyaljsk-vasjkn). The phrase is quite interesting and since I have participated in an acitivty similar to the one he is participating in, I though it would only be courteous to provide the link to his very insightful and helpful explanation of what Mkyaljsk Vasjkn means out of context. Though there may be other definitions, his is the first that I came across. Check out his [whole site](http://wesadvance.mkyaljskvasjkn.com/)!

Another small observation is that several people used the same website theme: [[1]](http://tranfong1991.github.io/), [[2]](http://baja-bob.com/), [[3]](http://santossolorzano.com/445/), [[4]](http://people.tamu.edu/~pawansingh9/cnm/), [[5]](http://josemanriquez.com/csce445/).
