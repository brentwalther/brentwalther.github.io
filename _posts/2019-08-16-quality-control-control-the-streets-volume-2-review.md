I really enjoyed the variety in production and features this album had to offer and the length was just the right amount. It's a perfect follow up to Volume 1 and it was fun to see so many different artists working together. My highlight tracks include *Frosted Flakes*, *Double Trouble*, *Magellanic*, and *Wiggle It*.
