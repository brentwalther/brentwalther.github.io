I really enjoyed the variety in production and features this album had to offer
and the length was just the right amount. It's a perfect follow up to Volume 1
and it was fun to see so many different artists working together. My highlight
tracks include _Frosted Flakes_, _Double Trouble_, _Magellanic_, and _Wiggle
It_.
