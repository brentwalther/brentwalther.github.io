Depite getting a 3/5 decent rating, this album was a bit boring to me. Logic
seems to think he's some genius who is completely out of other rappers league
but I disagree. He can rap fast and has some good lyrics but he's not as good as
he things he is and the songs on this album weren't particularly ineresting. Too
salty?
