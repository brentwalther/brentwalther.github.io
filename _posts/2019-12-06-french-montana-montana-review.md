A reasonably interesting album from French Montana. A decent portion of the tracks were out as singles before this album actually dropped and like many albums, they were probably the better tracks. I enjoyed *50s and 100s*, *No Stylist*, *Lockjaw*. The blueface feature on Slide was straight up cringy. Overall this album was very neutral for me.
