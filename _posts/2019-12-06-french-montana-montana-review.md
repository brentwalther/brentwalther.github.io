A reasonably interesting album from French Montana. A decent portion of the
tracks were out as singles before this album actually dropped and like many
albums, they were probably the better tracks. I enjoyed _50s and 100s_, _No
Stylist_, _Lockjaw_. The blueface feature on Slide was straight up cringy.
Overall this album was very neutral for me.
