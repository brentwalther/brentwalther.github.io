title: Rocket League Season 10
---
I'm still playing Rocket League 6 seasons later...

This season, I finally achieved the Champion season rank which is 3 ranks
beneath the top rank of Grand Champion. I played over 400+ games this season so
the grind was real.

Here's a screenshot of the when I went up a division (div 3) and got MVP:
