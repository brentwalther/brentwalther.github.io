I was a pretty big fan of this album. K.R.I.T. is (at this point) a very well
known southern artist and his flow and sound are great embodiments of that
southern style. The percussion in a bunch of the beats was really awesome and
the lyrics and flow were really great as well. He sounds a lot like T.I. at
times. My favorite tracks include *Believe*, *Prove It*, and *Learned From
Texas*.
