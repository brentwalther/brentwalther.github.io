There was a good amound of hype leading up to this album release including the invitation hype, singles, and documentary release. The level of artistic talent all packaged up in one album is absolutely insane. Amazing flows from J. Cole, JID, Maxo Kreme, EARTHGANG, Buddy and more. *Down Bad*, *Costa Rica*, and *Wells Fargo* go hard and there are some awesome rhymes in *Oh Wow...Swerve*, *Self Love*, *Ladies*, *1993*, and *Got Me*. Will definitely have this one on repeat for a while.
