There was a good amound of hype leading up to this album release including the
invitation hype, singles, and documentary release. The level of artistic talent
all packaged up in one album is absolutely insane. Amazing flows from J. Cole,
JID, Maxo Kreme, EARTHGANG, Buddy and more. _Down Bad_, _Costa Rica_, and _Wells
Fargo_ go hard and there are some awesome rhymes in _Oh Wow...Swerve_, _Self
Love_, _Ladies_, _1993_, and _Got Me_. Will definitely have this one on repeat
for a while.
