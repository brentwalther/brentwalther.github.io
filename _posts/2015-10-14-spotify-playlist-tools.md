A playlist diff tool and a playlist copier for Spotify. Built with Angular
during Summer 2015. I has grandiose dreams of building something with the pitch
"version control for your playlist". The idea was that you could 'fork' a
playlist which would copy all the songs and you could add any of your own that
you want but you could also merge in updates from the original playlist too. The
use case would be to fork one of the spotify-updated playlists and make it your
own.
