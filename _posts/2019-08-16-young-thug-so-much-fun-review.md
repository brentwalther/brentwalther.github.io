Decent album for Young Thug but i didn't find anything particularly special
about it. It's hard enough to get through the whine of Young Thug's voice as it
is, let alone actually enjoying mediocre lyrics. _Bad Bad Bad_ flows pretty
well. I liked the hook on _Cartier Gucci Scarf_ but the Lil Duke feature
completely ruined the song. I enjoyed the "Yee Yee" on _Sup Mate_.
