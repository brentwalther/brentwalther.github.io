Decent album for Young Thug but i didn't find anything particularly special about it. It's hard enough to get through the whine of Young Thug's voice as it is, let alone actually enjoying mediocre lyrics. *Bad Bad Bad* flows pretty well. I liked the hook on *Cartier Gucci Scarf* but the Lil Duke feature completely ruined the song. I enjoyed the "Yee Yee" on *Sup Mate*.
