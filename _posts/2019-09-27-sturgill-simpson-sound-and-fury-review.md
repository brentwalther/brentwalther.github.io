I wasn't sure how I felt about the lead single for this album *Sing Along* but after listening to it all the way through, I have to say I'm a big fan. The album has a big southern rock sound and vibe with good riffs and percussions that keep you interested in rocking all the way through. Sturgill incorporate some other unique sounds too throughout to keep you at the edge of your seat. Would definitely recommend.
