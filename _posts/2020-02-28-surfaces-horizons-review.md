I had never heard about this group until I saw this album on the Spotify New
Releases tab and I have to say it is amazing (I'm probably going to listen to
their whole discography now). I would describe is as a chill, acoustic, and soft
(but with exciting percussion). This is a very relaxing album and the production
behind it is incredible. They're from Texas, too! (I wonder where?)
