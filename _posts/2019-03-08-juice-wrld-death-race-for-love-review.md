This was a solid project and I was impressed with the quality given the number of featuers (few) and the length (~72 minutes). Juice WRLD seems to be pretty decent at tapping in to his own emotions and experiences for lyrical content; something many rappers his age don't do well enough. My favorite track was *Won't Let Go*.
