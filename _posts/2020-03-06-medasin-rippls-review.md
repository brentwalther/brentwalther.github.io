I first heard Medasin on a Spotify radio mix based off my chill/ambient playlist called *zoned*. I thought it fit the vibe perfectly and added a few songs from their previous album *Irene* to it. This is an awesome follow-up and is both chill and exciting. Fun melodies, some good trap percussion, and a few good vocal features. Big fan.
