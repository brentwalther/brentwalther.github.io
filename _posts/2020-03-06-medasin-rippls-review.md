I first heard Medasin on a Spotify radio mix based off my chill/ambient playlist
called _zoned_. I thought it fit the vibe perfectly and added a few songs from
their previous album _Irene_ to it. This is an awesome follow-up and is both
chill and exciting. Fun melodies, some good trap percussion, and a few good
vocal features. Big fan.
