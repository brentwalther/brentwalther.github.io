This album was pretty boring and lacked original style in my opinion. It kind of
sounded like a cross imitation of Travis Scott and Playboi Carti. The features
were probably the only saving grace but even the awesome ones like A$AP Rocky
and Tyler, the Creator on _T.D._ ended up kind of being ruined by Yachty
himself. As far as I'm concerned, Yachty's career is kind of done.
