Bass in your face via trap bangers and live guitar melodies mixed in. I've been listening to Hippie Sabotage for quite a while (hint: they make a great Pandora station for the beach) but had never seen them live. The tickets to go see this show were pretty inexpensive and the weather at Stubbs was perfect for a concert -- a cool 50s/60s temperature which only required a light jacket. Their performance just makes you want to jump to the beat.

They were opened by Sebastian Paul who though I didn't recognize by name I think has contributed vocals to some of their songs. After he warmed us up with some lighter songs, Hippie Sabotage took the stage and came out strong, with bass that shook you all the way through. Ever since I sold my highschool truck (which had a 500 watt (RMS) Alpine Type-R subwoofer installed), I don't get many opportunities to hear the kind of low frequency booming power that a live trap performance brings. I wouldn't necessarily consider Hippie Sabotage to be purely in the trap genre but their live performance brings heat.

Needless to say, I would definitely recommend you go to a show put on by this group if you're into hard hitting music. They hit everything from the deepest 20hz bottoming-out sounds to a loud 50, 75, 100 and more. They were big on predictably loud drops which I think really translated well into crowd energy. Check them out!
