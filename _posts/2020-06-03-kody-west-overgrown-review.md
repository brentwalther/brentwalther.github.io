This release (from Mar 2020) slipped by me somehow. Having not heard from Kody
West in quite some time, I was excited to learn there was new music. While I
didn't dislike this album, the overtones of it were much darker than his
previous release 'Green'. The sound has a very early 2000s rock vibe (which
admittedly I am not a huge fan of) but still, there were some decent tracks. The
trach _The Way_ was probably the highlight for me.
