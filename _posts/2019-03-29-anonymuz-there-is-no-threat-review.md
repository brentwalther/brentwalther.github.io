This album's got a few bangers on it that I liked. A few tracks have a pretty
unhappy vibe to them though and it seems like Anonymuz is going through some
emotional times and is facing some problems. After listening to a piece or work
like this, I would generally agree that he's probably not getting recognition
that is proportional to his talent. Still though, fans are usually not receptive
to tracks that are negative. My favorites off the album were *Primal* and
*Rxdical Forever*.
