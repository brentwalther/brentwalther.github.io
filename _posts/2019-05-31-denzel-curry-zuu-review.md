Despite being quite short, ZUU packs a lot of solid rhymes, a fair bit of
bounce, and some funny skits. Most of the beats are pretty forward with big bass
but Denzel delivers an incredible flow on top of it all. I'll definitely listen
again. My favorites include _Ricky_ (the single), _Wish_, and _Bushy B
Interlude_.
