This EP is really really short but despite being so, the lyrics are quite dense. As always, Earl's flow is crazy good and entire verses are composed of just a few syllable sounds. Entire sentences rhyme together - it's really impressive and one of the things that makes Earl unique. I appreciated the lower key production and beats so that we could actually hear him.
