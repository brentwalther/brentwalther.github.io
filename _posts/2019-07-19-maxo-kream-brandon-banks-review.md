I generally like Maxo and definitely have to give some support to a Texas artist (Maxo is from Houston). However, this album was really only decent in my opinion. I've grown a bit tired of the lyrical content Maxo raps about. It may all by true but it's way too repetitive at this point. Having said that, this album had some decent features and good beats. I liked the A$AP Ferg and Megan Thee Stallion features.
