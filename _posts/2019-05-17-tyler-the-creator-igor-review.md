We haven't heard from Tyler since his 2017 album Flower Boy which was a unique piece of work for Tyler. Flower Boy was very different in style and instruments but still had rap included. IGOR is the next step -- a collection of what I would call 80s/90s synthesizer sounds, fun percussion, and light/airy lyrics. It does break down to a few dirty basslines but it really incorporates a lot into one unified album. I really enjoyed it.
