I respect Royce a lot for the level of talent he delivers on album. There's a good reason he and Eminem collaborate together - they're both incredibly talented lyricists. I really liked the message and skits on this album and will definitely listen again. My initial standout tracks were *FUBU* and *Upside Down*.
