I respect Royce a lot for the level of talent he delivers on album. There's a
good reason he and Eminem collaborate together - they're both incredibly
talented lyricists. I really liked the message and skits on this album and will
definitely listen again. My initial standout tracks were _FUBU_ and _Upside
Down_.
