title: Cody's Graduation
---
Cody's been working hard for the last couple years going through the Ford certified technician ASSET program doing work and school at the same time. He graduated from the program this spring and has begun working full time at Five Star Ford in Carrollton, TX.

Big respect for finishing school and working at the same time! Congratulations Cody -- I'm proud of you!
