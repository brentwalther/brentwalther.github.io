A short but dense release. While it isn't new, RTJ (and Killer Mike in
particular) have really begun to focus lyrics on real issues. I like that, and
the tracks themselves are still really listenable albeit hard to follow at times
given the density of the lyrics. My favorite tracks were _holy calamafuck_ and
_pulling the pin_.
