I have not really kept up with what's called "Grime" but it's my understanding that Skepta is a big name out of the U.K. I first heard of Skepta through some collaborative work with A$AP Rocky and I really enjoyed his sound. I loved Skepta's flow and rhymes throughout and depite not thinking I could enjoy any English rappers, I really enjoyed this album. My favorites were *Redrum* and *Animal Instinct*.
