I have not really kept up with what's called "Grime" but it's my understanding
that Skepta is a big name out of the U.K. I first heard of Skepta through some
collaborative work with A$AP Rocky and I really enjoyed his sound. I loved
Skepta's flow and rhymes throughout and depite not thinking I could enjoy any
English rappers, I really enjoyed this album. My favorites were _Redrum_ and
_Animal Instinct_.
