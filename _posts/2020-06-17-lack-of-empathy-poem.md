title: Lack of Empathy
---
what I don't understand is undermining

the country that you live in wondering

why the public's out, sticking up their signs.

you fail to recognize that making america great again

doesn't involve guns, hate, and peppered eyes.

obsessed with crime.

you let the news abuse your mind

and then you use the news to find

some accusatory lines

but your shoes don't walk the line.

I doubt it's you who's been alive

long enough to see the signs

or the effects of tougher times

but because it's *you* who's so sublime

means it's you that knows we're fine.

empathy is gone
