I was pretty dissapointed by this release. There was a bit of hype online including a long [leaked tracklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/travisscott/comments/eg28sy/leaked_tracklist/) that didn't actually make it out. The *HIGHEST IN THE ROOM* remix was interesting and *WHAT TO DO* was pretty decent but *GANG GANG* and *GATTI* were not good and the entire EP? Album? was only 21 minutes including a remix and 40 second intro. I hope this will get revised to include some of the other tracks.
