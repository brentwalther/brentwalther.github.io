I was pretty dissapointed by this release. There was a bit of hype online
including a long
[leaked tracklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/travisscott/comments/eg28sy/leaked_tracklist/)
that didn't actually make it out. The _HIGHEST IN THE ROOM_ remix was
interesting and _WHAT TO DO_ was pretty decent but _GANG GANG_ and _GATTI_ were
not good and the entire EP? Album? was only 21 minutes including a remix and 40
second intro. I hope this will get revised to include some of the other tracks.
