I'm a big fan of Wale's style and this album is a solid exhibition of it. Good
variety in types of sound (some more trappy, many R&B, some simple rap flow).
It's filled with a good selection of features too which keep it interesting all
the way through. My highlight tracks are _Cliche_, _Expectations_ and _Debbie_.
