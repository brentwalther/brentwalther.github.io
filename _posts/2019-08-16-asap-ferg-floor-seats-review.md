It's been quite some time since Ferg has dropped an album so I was happy to see
something new from him this year. The style hasn't changed much from some of the
stuff he's previously done but there isn't anything wrong with that in my
opinion. A small collection of solid songs. My favorites were _Jet Lag_, _Butt
Naked_ and _Pups_.
