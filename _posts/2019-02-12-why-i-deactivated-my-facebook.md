title: Why I deactivated Facebook
---
I signed up for a Facebook account back in 2008 when the platform was still
fairly young. I was in high school at the time and it was a pretty trendy thing
to do (having recently opened up from the previous exclusivity it had to
university students). From the beginning, I've appreciated Facebook for the
grand vision that Mark Zuckerberg had (has?) for it: To connect the world. I
really enjoyed sharing photos, creating, subscribing, and joining local events,
and keeping up with friends that I've made in life. Facebook is still the
de-facto standard when it comes to connectivity with your 'social' network of
friends, family, and acquaintances. More recently though, I began to feel like
Facebook was losing personal value for me and I was seeing too much bad press:
frightening news stories about the companies questionable privacy practices and
academic publishings shedding light on some of the psychological effects
Facebook has on society. So, I decided that I was finished (at least for now and
it would probably be a tough sell to convince me otherwise) with Facebook.

## Questionable privacy practices

It's probably not (or at least, I hope that it isn't) news to you that Facebook
isn't nearly as concerned about the privacy of their users relative to other
companies with the same level of world impact. Some examples of just how
terrible of a job Facebook has done at educating and protecting users:

1. Exposing (or just handing over?) data of nearly **50 million** U.S. based
   users from to Cambridge Analytica \[1\] "as a way to identify the personalities
   of American voters and influence their behavior." \[2\]
1. Allowing Russia (and probably others) to produce and disseminate fake news
   and propaganda to over 790,000 users via "nearly 500 pages and accounts" and
   $135,000 worth of ad spend on Facebook. \[3\]
1. Until mid-2015, allowing app developers (for example: Farmville, Candy Crush)
   to suck in all of an individual's friends data if that individual gives
   "basic" permissions to an app. The implication here is that there are
   countless companies (even bad actors) out there with **your** information
   because your friend logged into their app. \[4\]
1. The long-held conspiracy (I describe it as a conspiracy only because I'm
   unable to confirm that it's true) that Facebook is listening to your
   conversations as a means of picking up keywords to use for advertisement
   targeting. I've heard anecdotal evidence from numerous people and even had it
   happen to me. Did you know that Facebook (Oh, and don't forget that Facebook
   owns Instagram and Whatsapp too) requests (and very likely has) microphone
   permission on your phone? Many people don't. If you never intend to talk to
   the app, why is it enabled?

The list goes on, but what has become clear to me is that Facebook is unable to
handle the scale at which they operate. What's worse is that most people are
apathetic to these facts and simply don't care. I may not be able to convince
you to care about protecting your own data, but it's flat out reckless for a
company having the data of _billions_ of users to not protect it properly. Just
so we're clear - I'm not claiming that Facebook isn't trying to improve this
situation, just that they've done a terrible job up until now and their platform
is still growing.

I do acknowledge that I may have bias against Facebook because I currently work
at Google who as a company I consider to be much more conscious of user data
privacy \[7\]. Still, I feel as if there are too many bright people working at
Facebook to display such negligence. If you're building a product for billions
of people, you need to do the due diligence to protect them.

## Facebook's value to me

These privacy issues were very concerning to me but they are not the only reason
that I decided to deactivate my account. As I mentioned above, I have
historically found a lot of value in Facebook and do honestly still appreciate
their overarching mission. I enjoyed seeing what some of my old friends were up
to and being able to share my own updates (which have been almost 100% pictures
for the past few years). However, I slowly began to see too much junk in my news
feed: tagged photos that took me long moments to figure out who I knew in the
picture, random clickbait or news that friends had shared that I didn't care
about, and people fishing for likes and comments on their latest and greatest
everything (I've been guilty of this too, more below). As a consequence, I
started 'unfollowing' people so that their content would no longer show up in my
feed but we'd still stay friends. It started with just a few, but it grew to
10s, and eventually became over 100. I had to ask myself: "If I don't care about
what over 100 people I'm 'friends' with have to say or share, why am I still on
Facebook?"

Hiding people was only a bandage on the bigger problem of Facebook for me.
Despite having 'hidden' tons of people, there were still a lot of folks that
were in that grey area of "I still enjoy seeing what you post, but only about
half the time." For many people, Facebook has become the easiest and most
powerful soapbox they have access to and they feel the need to use it to blast
their opinions to every single one of their friends.

Am I somebody that wants to curtail freedom of thought and opinion? No.

Am I somebody who thinks that people don't deserve to be heard? Also no.

However, Facebook isn't the right platform to do it - most of the responses you
get are either people vehemently opposing you (but without the power
face-to-face conversation has) or reinforcing you. In either case, it doesn't
have real social perspective. Many people say things they would never out loud
in public physically standing there next to other people. Plus, what value does
making the entire conversation public to all 1000 of your friends have?

It goes further than just opinions. I've begun to see (and indeed, many
academics have published studies related to this) a lot more people base their
own personal value on the quality of their online profiles. Every picture has to
be perfect. Every post needs to make people think that I'm cool and do cool
things. "Throwback Thursday" becomes re-posting some of your most cherished
experiences so that people don't forget you've done it. Most people's profiles
become a giant facade where somebody's opinion of them isn't based on who they
actually are or what they actually do; it's based on the image their profile
portrays.

I understand and sympathize with people who've fallen into this trap because
I've been there myself. Everyone seeks to be confident and validated and what
easier way to do that than post something you're proud of and have people 'like'
it. The more likes, the better, right? Yet, a big list of people that have liked
your content ends up being pretty meaningless in the end when you realize that
all they did was scroll past it, read it or look at it, and click or tap a
button. It's not a valuable validation in my opinion and it isn't very genuine.
I didn't like feeling these things when I posted stuff (and it's hard not to) I
took the method I know best: Resisting temptation by removing it.

I was getting tired of crummy privacy standards, easy-mode soapboxes, echo
chambers, and insincere social interactions so I decided to deactivate my
Facebook.
