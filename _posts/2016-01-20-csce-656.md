Howdy everyone.

My name is Brent Walther and I'm a second year grad student here at Texas
A&M. I'm pursing the non-thesis track of the Master in Computer Science
degree and I am headed to Google Seattle to work full time after I graduate in
May 2016.

I chose to sign up for this course because I felt that I have had lots of
algorithmic and coding experience throughout my academic career but am lacking
in other knowledge associated with out field such as the knowledge that this
course provides. I think the class will turn out to be very useful
