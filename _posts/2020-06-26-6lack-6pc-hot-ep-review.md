6lack's been talking about this new release on social media for a while and I've
been really excited to hear it. Though I didn't realize it would be a short EP,
the quality was not disappointing. I really like how 6lack perfectly hits a
combo of smooth R&B and actually good rap. My favorite tracks from this release
were _Float_ and _Elephant In The Room_.
