I actually did not have high expectations for this album. Before starting it, I
was sort of expecting to hear 60 minutes of unintelligible syllables but was
pleasently surprised when I could understand and enjoy nearly the entire album.
My one highlight track was _Green Lit_ but I thought it was a pretty solid piece
of work overall.
