I actually did not have high expectations for this album. Before starting it, I was sort of expecting to hear 60 minutes of unintelligible syllables but was pleasently surprised when I could understand and enjoy nearly the entire album. My one highlight track was *Green Lit* but I thought it was a pretty solid piece of work overall.
