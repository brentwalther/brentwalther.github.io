I'm curious to know more about the production on Kevin Gates' albums because they generally all have a fantastic collection of smooth beats. Besides rapping, Kevin Gates also tends to sing some on the tracks which usually sounds great. This album isn't an exception there, and there were plenty of tracks I vibed with. The subject matter of some of the songs exclude them from being good candidates for your back yard BBQ but otherwise are all pretty solid.
