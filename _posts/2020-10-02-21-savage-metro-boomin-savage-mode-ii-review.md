Exciting album with high energy trap beats and your typical 21 Savage flows. I was surprised at the lyrical content (it was better than I expected for 21). I'll probably give this another listen soon to pick out some bangers, but my initial favorites include *Rich Nigga Shit* and *Many Men*. I liked that *Many Men* paid homage to 50 Cent too!
