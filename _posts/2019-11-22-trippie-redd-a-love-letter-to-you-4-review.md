I have to say, I have really not been a fan of some of Trippie Redd's previous releases. His albums "!" and "LIFE'S A TRIP" were so bad (in my opinion) that I had to turn them off midway through listening to them. This one is much better! It fits securely in the emo-rap genre and sounds very XXXTentacion-esque with plenty of guitar and vocal singing along with some raw bars. I'd listen to this one again.
