I really enjoyed this album and of the three recent(ish) independent albums by
Migos members Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff, I think I like this one the best. I
honestly thought this album would be too homogenous for me to enjoy but Offset
seemed to stretch a bit and have a decent variety of subject matter and
features. Favorite tracks after 1 listen were _Father of 4_ and _Quarter Milli_.
