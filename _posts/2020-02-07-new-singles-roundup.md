- **Believe (ft. Justin Timberlake) - Meek Mill** // **Play** // Solid song.
  Meek's got a good flow and Justin Timberlake fits well on the song.
- **Intentions (ft. Quavo) - Justin Bieber** // **Play** // Biebers music has
  grown on my in recent years. This is a new sound for Quavo too and I liked it.
- **YELL OH (ft. Young Thug) - Trippie Redd** // _Pass_ // Sort of cringey. When
  would someone want to play this song? Pierre Bourne's chaotic production is
  coupled with a crummy immature hook.
- **Run - Joji** // **Play** // The last Joji I tried listening to was his album
  _BALLADS 1_ which I didn't like at all. I liked both the vocals and
  instrumentation of this single though, and it makes me optimistic for his
  upcoming album.
- **Blueberry Faygo - Lil Mosey** // _Pass_ // Sort of divided on this one. The
  beat has a nice bounce to it but song is so short and he basically just
  repeats the hook over and over. Meh.
- **Broke In A Minute - Torey Lanez** // **Play** // Has a freestyle vibe to it
  and I enjoyed it. Beat is cool and kind of makes me want to try and rhyme on
  it too.
- **IDK - Lil Tecca** // _Pass_ // Not original. If Tecca thought he could still
  ride the wave of his sole hit, he's wrong.
