- **Believe (ft. Justin Timberlake) - Meek Mill** // **Play** // Solid song. Meek's got a good flow and Justin Timberlake fits well on the song.
- **Intentions (ft. Quavo) - Justin Bieber** // **Play** // Biebers music has grown on my in recent years. This is a new sound for Quavo too and I liked it.
- **YELL OH (ft. Young Thug) - Trippie Redd** // *Pass* // Sort of cringey. When would someone want to play this song? Pierre Bourne's chaotic production is coupled with a crummy immature hook. 
- **Run - Joji** // **Play** // The last Joji I tried listening to was his album *BALLADS 1* which I didn't like at all. I liked both the vocals and instrumentation of this single though, and it makes me optimistic for his upcoming album.
- **Blueberry Faygo - Lil Mosey** // *Pass* // Sort of divided on this one. The beat has a nice bounce to it but song is so short and he basically just repeats the hook over and over. Meh.
- **Broke In A Minute - Torey Lanez** // **Play** // Has a freestyle vibe to it and I enjoyed it. Beat is cool and kind of makes me want to try and rhyme on it too.
- **IDK - Lil Tecca** // *Pass* // Not original. If Tecca thought he could still ride the wave of his sole hit, he's wrong.
