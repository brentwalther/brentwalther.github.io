Flume is pretty well known for several groovy electronic tunes but I hadn't heard much about him for a while so this album release took me by surprise. The album delivers some heavy kick and punch accompanied by experimental melodies. I feel like it's a well-rounded collection of songs that don't bore from being too similar. My favorites were *Dreamtime* and *MUD* and I liked the basslines in *Amber*.
