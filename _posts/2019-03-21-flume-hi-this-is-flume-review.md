Flume is pretty well known for several groovy electronic tunes but I hadn't
heard much about him for a while so this album release took me by surprise. The
album delivers some heavy kick and punch accompanied by experimental melodies. I
feel like it's a well-rounded collection of songs that don't bore from being too
similar. My favorites were _Dreamtime_ and _MUD_ and I liked the basslines in
_Amber_.
