Another surprise album out by Eminem, or 'Slim Shady' as listed on the album cover. Dense rhyming with a good variety of beats, flows, and features. The lyrical content is all over the place with some reflective, some "roast", some very much sounding like the classic "slim shady" sound. My favorite tracks were *You Gon' Learn* and *Lock It Up*.
