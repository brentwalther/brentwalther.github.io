A pretty standard DJ album with a good variety of songs and types of
beats/rythyms. There is a little bit of rap, moombahton, trap, and more all
mixed in to one. My favorites off the album were _Butterfly Effect_ (the second
track titled Butterfly Effect that made it to a playlist), the single _Enzo_,
_Magenta Riddim_, and _No Option_.
