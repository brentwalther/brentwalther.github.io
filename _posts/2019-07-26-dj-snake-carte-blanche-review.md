A pretty standard DJ album with a good variety of songs and types of beats/rythyms. There is a little bit of rap, moombahton, trap, and more all mixed in to one. My favorites off the album were *Butterfly Effect* (the second track titled Butterfly Effect that made it to a playlist), the single *Enzo*,  *Magenta Riddim*, and *No Option*.
