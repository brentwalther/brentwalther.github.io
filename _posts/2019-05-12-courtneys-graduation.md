author: Brent Walther

We made another trip down to College Station in May to watch my sister Courtney
graduate from Texas A&amp;M! She'll be starting a job teaching in Prosper ISD an
elemantary school teacher this upcoming school year.

We attended her graduation party the following day and despite rain had a great
time eating BBQ and tacos, listening to tunes, playing a few games of LCR (my
first time), seeing tons of family members, and being merry!

We're proud of you Courtney. Congratulations on graduating!
