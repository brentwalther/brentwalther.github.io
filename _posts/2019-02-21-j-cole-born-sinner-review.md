I've listened through this album in the past but wanted to do it again and
listen a little more critically. I'm glad I did. J. Cole is known for his
incredible flow and content and this album is no exception. Outstanding lyricism
and content that doesn't just 'flex' but tells real stories about his life and
perception of society. Definitely worth a listen.
