I haven't been keeping up with what Logic's been working on lately and I did not
expect an album like this from him. Instead of the usual technical lyricism he
had in YSIV or Bobby Tarantino II, this album is much more instrumental,
melodic, and has more singing than rapping. This is the kind of stuff you'd
share with someone who didn't like rap to show off Logic's talent. My favorite
tracks were _Vacation from Myself_ and _I Love You Forever_.
