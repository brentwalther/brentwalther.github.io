There wasn't a whole lot that stood out in this album from the standard Wiz and Curren$y stuff but I really enjoyed it regardless. It's a proper 'smoking' album and they both delivered a pretty solid performance. Solid flows and beats. My favorites tracks were *Benz Boyz (feat. Ty Dolla $ign)* and *No Clout Chasin*.
