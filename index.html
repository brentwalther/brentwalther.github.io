      <p>Howdy, I'm Brent. I'm a software engineer currently working for Google and graduated from <a href="http://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a> in 2014. I became interested in computers and eventually learned programming in the late 90s and early 2000s. Hopefully this website's style brings some nostalgic joy. :)</p>
      <p>In my free time I enjoy playing video games like <a href="https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/76561198099061550">Rocket League</a>, listening to <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/brentwalther">music</a>, learning about personal finance, and driving my trucks. If you want to chat, shoot me an <a href="mailto:brent@walther.io">email</a>.</p>
