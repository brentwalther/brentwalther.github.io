      <h4>(a.k.a. radio cooler v2)</h4>
      <p>The <a href="#radio-cooler">custom radio cooler</a> I built in college (and other <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/cv6negoigsTsUUNs7">prior art</a>) has seen a lot of fun times between tailgates, pool days, tailgates, and hunting trips. However, it was built optimizing for battery life at the cost of portability (the 100 Ah battery weighs a ton!). I decided I wanted to build something sleeker and more portable, so I did.</p>
      <p>The first step was choosing some type of case. Coolers are pretty convenient because they're easy to cut through and they can be fairly water resistant but they are also difficult to seal well. I began looking at electrical junction boxes (and I still think one could work quite well) but many had awkward dimensions and I wasn't sure if drilling or cutting through them would work well. I finally settled on a latching plastic case meant for electrical components or firearms. It seals well and has a convenient handle already installed. It also was long enough to fit three speakers.</p>

      <p>I carefully measured and cut out holes for the speakers using a dremel tool. I used a tiny cutting wheel to get a rough shape first and then used one of the sanding heads to round them out. If I did it again, I would have taped templates down from the start to get perfectly round holes. After cutting the holes, I installed the speakers using bolts and wing nuts.</p>
      <p>The components on the inside are mounted via aluminum C-channel I found at Home Depot. It was inexpensive, reasonably strong, light weight, and shouldn't rust if any moisture gets inside. The two T brackets ended up getting mounted behind the battery to two cross members.</p>

      <p>The finished radio looks quite nice from the front and uses a small trickle charger to charge up. It sits easily upright though I would love to have a way to also sit it on its side so the three speakers were stacked. The sound is very directional so it's best placed facing where you want the music to go.</p>
      <p>The inside of the cooler is slightly messier than I'd like but it's still a work in progress. The battery is held in place via paracord to give it some wiggle room. A bluetooth module (which I'll likely replace with something better) is mounted on top of the amp with a web of zip ties and some more bolts. A switch is placed alongside a 2-port USB power hub that shows the battery voltage to give an approximate idea of charge level.</p>

      <p>The rear only contains 4 mounting bolts which can be easily sealed with silicon caulking. The radio is significantly more portable than the previous iteration and can be carried with one hand like a suit case.</p>

      <p>After having seen a few in the wild and having one crummy proof-of-concept build, I ordered parts for and built a brand new radio cooler in the fall of 2013. It started with two speakers and grew to four and has since been used hundreds of times between tailgates, beaches, and poolsides. It lasts longer, is way louder, and is much more hardy than a lot of store-bought speaker systems. I built mine to be as water resistant as possible; I used all marine audio equipment and tried to make decent seals around the speakers and lid. It can get rained on or be thrown into a river float and still provide powerful loud sound for tens of hours.</p>

      <h3>Components</h3>
      <p> My radio cooler is built from mostly inexpensive components and was constructed such that any component can be swapped out quite easily. For this build, I used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XO674/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0001XO674&linkCode=as2&tag=brentwalther-20&linkId=d27a93d077a8b48311c50f636e829d00">BOSS Audio MR60W 200 Watt Weatherproof Marine Speaker Pair</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=brentwalther-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0001XO674" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> - ($24.99 x 2) - I used 4. They are cheap, can by pumped with power, and have really taken a beating without deteriorating in quality. I'd recommend them for low to medium budget builds.</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N5T0T4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000N5T0T4&linkCode=as2&tag=brentwalther-20&linkId=a5fdc9ea3b73f74269d88b1036aba20f">Pyle Hydra Marine 400 Watt 4 Channel Audio Amplifier</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=brentwalther-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000N5T0T4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> - ($43.55) - For the price, this thing is hard to beat. It can get loud enough to make the speakers vibrate the lid of the cooler with air movement. It's powerful.</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.walmart.com/search/?cat_id=0&query=12v+marine+battery">Marine-grade deep cycle 12V battery</a> ($40 - $200) of some sort. The greater the amp hour (Ah) rating of the battery, the longer it will last between recharges. Get one that fits your price range. I use a 101 Ah battery and it lasts for several multi-hour uses before needing any recharge.</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000Dh3LT/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0000Dh3LT&linkCode=as2&tag=brentwalther-20&linkId=c879ce06997cab67615feb50507b7641">Coleman 48-Quart Cooler</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=brentwalther-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0000Dh3LT" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> ($36.09) - I bought mine at Academy but Amazon has them too.</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074Z2NFWW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B074Z2NFWW&linkCode=as2&tag=brentwalther-20&linkId=3aa12c3487b5db0571a9c7507a6e1af6">12V Trickle Battery Charger</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=brentwalther-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B074Z2NFWW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> - ($16.98) - Inexpensive and better on your battery but expect long overnight charge times. The faster you charge the battery, the less total recharge cycles it will last so a low current trickle charger optimizes for battery longevity.
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FKP7TY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FKP7TY&linkCode=as2&tag=brentwalther-20&linkId=32e4c67c63df1578e4992fc4e34990fd">BOSS Audio 8 Gauge Amplifier Wiring Kit</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=brentwalther-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000FKP7TY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> - ($14.99) - Inexpensive and has almost everything you need to wire it all up. You may end up needing special electrical connectors or battery terminal connectors.</li>
        <li>One <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D5H8JW0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01D5H8JW0&linkCode=as2&tag=brentwalther-20&linkId=007bc4dec686f1b292f0a9b916c21aac">3.5mm to 2-Male RCA Adapter Cable</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=brentwalther-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01D5H8JW0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> ($5.99)</li>
        <li>One <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016FCTD3G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B016FCTD3G&linkCode=as2&tag=brentwalther-20&linkId=91f7f82d753ff157015649c37a283d6b">RCA Female to 2 RCA Male Splitter Adapter Pair</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=brentwalther-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B016FCTD3G" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> ($5.69)</li>
        <li>Some type of toggle switch.</li>
        <li>Some bolts and wing nuts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So all together it costs around $275 to build one of these give or take some depending on what kind of battery you use. You can also use any type of cooler that you feel comfortable mounting the amplifier and speakers in.</p>

        <p>Putting one of these together is much easier than it looks. The battery essentially hooks straight to the amplifier and the amplifier straight to the speakers. After that, you just need to wire in a toggle switch from amplifier (+) to the amplifier toggle post. Plug in the RCA adapters in connecting the amp to your phone (or other aux/RCA output). Turn it on and start jamming!</p>
        <p>A common question I get about this cooler is whether or not it can actually hold drinks. The answer for my build is no. In order to maintain relative dryness inside the cooler, I try not to invite liquids (except perhaps sunscreen) inside.</p>
