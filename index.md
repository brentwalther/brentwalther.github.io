Howdy! I'm Brent.

I'm a software engineer currently working for Google in Austin, TX and
graduated from [Texas A&amp;M University](http://www.tamu.edu) in 2014. I
learned programming as a kid in the 90s/00s while hanging out in IRC chat (mIRC) and browsing forums (SwiftIRC, namely). These days I'm most experienced with Java and Android.

If I'm not programming, I'm probably playing video games like
[Rocket League](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/76561198099061550),
listening to [music](https://www.last.fm/user/brentwalther), learning about
personal finance, or driving my trucks. If you want to chat, shoot me an
[email](mailto:brent@walther.io).
