Howdy! I'm Brent.

I'm a software engineer currently working for Google in Austin, TX and
graduated from [Texas A&amp;M University](http://www.tamu.edu) in 2014. I've been interested in programming/computing since the 90s ([mIRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC_scripting_language)?) and these days I'm most experienced with Java and Android. I've shipped code in 10+ programming languages across mobile, web, server, and server-less applications.

If I'm not programming, I'm probably playing video games like
[Rocket League](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/profile/steam/76561198099061550),
listening to [music](https://www.last.fm/user/brentwalther), learning about
personal finance, or driving my [trucks](/trucks). If you want to chat, shoot me an
[email](mailto:brent@walther.io).
