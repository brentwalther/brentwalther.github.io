        <p>
          <strong>Software Engineer III</strong> &bull; Austin, TX &bull; Google Play Services (GMS Core) &bull; Oct 2018 &ndash; Present
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Modularized our code base by splitting up monolithic build targets into finer grained targets and optimizing compile-time binary variant calculations. These improve build time, reduce overall technical debt, and automate configuration.</li>
          <li>Improved GmsCore module release flexibility through several new features including versioned prebuilts, cross-Android-user module feature sharing, improved after-boot/after-upgrade module availability latency, and introduced virtual placebos to reduce noise in system health metrics via control/treatment experiments while simultaneously reducing the cost of deployment to user devices.</li>
          <li>Modernized and stabilized code base by integrating Google Guava collections where appropriate and refactoring tests with Google Truth and Robolectric libraries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Software Engineer III</strong> &bull; Seattle, WA &bull; Google Maps for Android (aGMM) &bull; Oct 2017 &ndash; Sept 2018
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed and documented an end-to-end notification feature for Google Maps for Android and hosted two Google EP interns who successfully implemented and demoed the feature at the end of their summer internship.</li>
          <li>Implemented client side and a significant amount of server-side code to double the number of eligible commute notifications users (XX million DAU).</li>
          <li>Implemented four separate experiments to improve quality and CTR metrics for commute notifications. All four improved our internal quality metric.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Software Engineer II</strong> &bull; Seattle, WA &bull; Google Maps for Android (aGMM) &bull; Aug 2016 &ndash; Oct 2017
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented new traffic-jam rendering logic and a brand new traffic-polyline generator that integrated with the map rendering team's brand new APIs.</li>
          <li>Launched a new traffic incident inspection card which integrated three new pieces of incident metadata in over 20 languages.</li>
          <li>Fixed two major accessibility issues within aGMM; one in the directions page header and one relating to TalkBack behavior within a scrolling view.</li>
          <li>Launched an Android shortcut and in-app promo for it in aGMM. The promo gets a 7% CTR. The shortcut is responsible for about 6% of all external invocations of the app to the traffic hub screen in aGMM.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong> &bull; Seattle, WA &bull; Google Maps for Android (aGMM) &bull; May 2015 &ndash; Aug 2015

        <ul>
	        <li>Built two production ready features that both ended up launching.</li>
          <li>Turned a mock from a slide deck into a fully functioning feature touching each piece of Google's multi-tiered directions stack.</li>
          <li>Designed and implemented a new data format for the internal Google Maps Directions/Navigation API.</li>
          <li>Prototyped 3 different ideas for a directions UI improvement and fully implemented one of them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong> &bull; Mountain View, CA &bull; Java Platform &bull; May 2014 &ndash; Aug 2014
        </p>
