<h3>Minecraft Controller Mod</h3>
<p><a class="nav-link" href="https://github.com/brentwalther/minecraft-controller-mod">Source</a></p>
<p>Developed in early 2018 onward, this is a mod that uses MinecraftForge to enable controller use for the PC version of Minecraft. Instructions for setting up and using are in the repository readme. Once setup, it's as simple as turning on your controller and pressing "run" in the IDE. The Mod uses XInput and should work anywhere XInput is supported.</p>
